make a game where iplay as differernt birds and try collecting different foods. i will need to be able to do various things e.g. grasping, spearing , digging. how effective these methods are depend on the bird due to their beak type. trying a method their beak is not adapted for should be ineffective e.g. if the beak is not good for grasping they might drop things, if it is not good for spearing it will not puncture and if it is not good at digging it will be very slow and ineffective (think breaking blocks without tools in minecraft). each birds beak should be ranked on different features e.g. pointiness, grip, digging efficiency. there should be a food bar that runs out over time but goes up when you eat.
